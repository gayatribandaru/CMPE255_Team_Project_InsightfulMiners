### Overview

This project, developed by the InsightfulMiners team, aims to create a robust system for cross-language topic modeling. Our goal is to enhance the understanding of multilingual content by mapping topics accurately and efficiently across documents in different languages.

### Project Scope:  

Inclusion Criteria:  

- Selection of multilingual datasets for analysis.  

- Development of preprocessing tools for language normalization.    

- Implementation of a topic modeling algorithm compatible with TF-IDF outputs.  

Exclusion Criteria:  

- Non-textual data.  

- Single-language datasets.  

 

### Methodology:  

1. Data Collection: Gather multilingual datasets from specified sources, ensuring a variety of languages and topics.  

2. Preprocessing: Normalize the data by cleaning, tokenizing, and stemming to prepare for cross-language analysis.  

3. Topic Modeling: Use an advanced topic modeling algorithm (e.g., Latent Dirichlet Allocation) to identify topics within each language corpus.  

4. Cross-Language Alignment: Implement a strategy to align the topics discovered across different languages, possibly using bilingual dictionaries or machine translation.  

5. Evaluation: Evaluate the model's effectiveness using metrics such as coherence, perplexity, and alignment accuracy.
